/*
Project overview - Develop foreach and if-else structures to process array data
You're developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

1. Create a C# console application.

2. Start with four students. Each student has five exam scores.

3. Each exam score is an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.

4. A student's overall exam score is the average of their five exam scores.

Criteria for extra credit assignments:

1. Include extra credit assignment scores in the student's scores array.
2. Extra credit assignments are worth 10% of an exam score (when calculating the final numeric grade).
3. Add extra credit assignment scores to the student's total exam score before calculating the final numeric grade.
4. Your application needs to automatically assign letter grades based on the calculated final score for each student.

Your application needs to output/display each student’s name and formatted grade.

Your application needs to support adding other students and scores with minimal impact to the code.
