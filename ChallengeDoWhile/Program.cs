/*
validates integer input
Here are the conditions that your first coding project must implement:

Your solution must include either a do-while or while iteration.

Before the iteration block: your solution must use a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.

Inside the iteration block:

Your solution must use a Console.ReadLine() statement to obtain input from the user.
Your solution must ensure that the input is a valid representation of an integer.
If the integer value isn't between 5 and 10, your code must use a Console.WriteLine() statement to prompt the user for an integer value between 5 and 10.
Your solution must ensure that the integer value is between 5 and 10 before exiting the iteration.
Below (after) the iteration code block: your solution must use a Console.WriteLine() statement to inform the user that their input value has been accepted.
